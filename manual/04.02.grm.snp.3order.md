## grm.snp.3order

### Purpose

The `grm.snp.3order` program calculates third-order epistatic Genomic Relationship Matrices (GRMs). It takes previously computed second-order GRMs (like additive `.g.A`, additive x additive `.g.AA`, dominance x dominance `.g.DD`) as input and computes their Hadamard (element-wise) products to form third-order interaction matrices.

The specific third-order GRMs it can generate are:

*   Additive x Additive x Additive (`.g.AAA`), from `.g.A` and `.g.AA`.
*   Additive x Dominance x Dominance (`.g.ADD`), from `.g.A` and `.g.DD`.
*   Additive x Additive x Dominance (`.g.AAD`), from `.g.D` and `.g.AA`.
*   Dominance x Dominance x Dominance (`.g.DDD`), from `.g.D` and `.g.DD`.

These matrices represent higher-order epistatic interactions and can be used in advanced genetic models. The program is optimized for large files using memory mapping or buffered I/O and can leverage multithreading.

### Options

*   **Positional Argument:** `<base_name>`
    *   This is the primary input. It's the base name from which input GRM file names are constructed and to which output GRM extensions are appended.
    *   For example, if `<base_name>` is `myproject`, the program will look for input files like `myproject.g.A`, `myproject.g.AA`, `myproject.g.D`, `myproject.g.DD` (depending on the operation). Output files will be named like `myproject.g.AAA`.

*   `-h, --help`:
    *   Displays a help message summarizing usage and options, then exits.

*   `-b, --buffer SIZE`:
    *   Specifies the buffer size for I/O operations. This can be given with units like `M` (for Megabytes) or `G` (for Gigabytes), e.g., `256M` or `2G`.
    *   The program uses this as a guideline, and the actual memory used will be roughly three times this size (for two input buffers and one output buffer).
    *   Default: System-dependent, often based on L3 cache size and number of threads (e.g., 32M per L3 cache slice).

*   `-t, --threads N`:
    *   Sets the number of OpenMP threads to use for computation.
    *   Default: Maximum number of threads available on the system.

**Operation Filters:**

If none of these options are specified, the program will attempt to compute all four third-order GRMs.

*   `--aaa`:
    *   Compute only the Additive x Additive x Additive (`.g.AAA`) matrix. Requires `<base_name>.g.A` and `<base_name>.g.AA` to exist.
*   `--add`:
    *   Compute only the Additive x Dominance x Dominance (`.g.ADD`) matrix. Requires `<base_name>.g.A` and `<base_name>.g.DD` to exist.
*   `--aad`:
    *   Compute only the Additive x Additive x Dominance (`.g.AAD`) matrix. Requires `<base_name>.g.D` and `<base_name>.g.AA` to exist.
*   `--ddd`:
    *   Compute only the Dominance x Dominance x Dominance (`.g.DDD`) matrix. Requires `<base_name>.g.D` and `<base_name>.g.DD` to exist.

### Example Usage

Suppose you have already computed GRMs for a project named `proj1` and have the following files:
*   `proj1.g.A`
*   `proj1.g.D`
*   `proj1.g.AA`
*   `proj1.g.DD`

To compute all third-order GRMs for `proj1` using 8 threads and a buffer of 512MB:
```bash
./bin/grm.snp.3order --threads 8 --buffer 512M proj1
```
This will produce:
*   `proj1.g.AAA`
*   `proj1.g.AAD`
*   `proj1.g.ADD`
*   `proj1.g.DDD`

To compute only the `.g.AAA` matrix:
```bash
./bin/grm.snp.3order --aaa proj1
```
This will produce `proj1.g.AAA`.
