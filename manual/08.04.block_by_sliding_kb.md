## block-by-sliding-kb.py

### Purpose

generate block definition files based number of kbs, the minimum distance per block the start of each block slides by user defined number of snps

### Options

For a detailed and accurate list of command-line options and their usage, run the script with the `--help` flag:

```bash
python scripts/block-by-sliding-kb.py --help
```

The script accepts the following command-line options. Arguments marked with an asterisk (*) are inherited from a common utility parser.

*   `-m/--map MAP` (*): path to map file [required]. Format: 'SNPID Chr Pos' with header.
*   `-s/--size SIZE`: minimum size of each block in kbs (Default: 100)
*   `-t/--step STEP`: number of snps between block starting points (Default: 1)
*   `--noheader`: use if map file has no header (Default: False)
*   `-o/--output OUTPUT` (*): output file name (Default: hap_info)
*   `-V/--verbose` (*): verbose output (Default: False)

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how `block-by-sliding-kb.py` might be run:

```bash
python scripts/block-by-sliding-kb.py \
    --map mygenome.map \
    --size 150 \
    --step 10 \
    --output sliding_kb_blocks_150k_10s \
    --noheader \
    --verbose
```

This command instructs the script to:

- Use `mygenome.map` as the input map file (SNPID, Chromosome, Position).
- Define blocks that span a minimum of 150 kilobases (kbs).
- Slide the starting point of each subsequent block by 10 SNPs.
- Assume the input map file does not have a header row.
- Save the output to a folder named `sliding_kb_blocks_150k_10s`.
- Provide verbose output during the process.

**Note:** The actual option names and usage may differ. Please consult the script's `--help` output for precise information.
