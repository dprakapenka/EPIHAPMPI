## grm.hap

### Purpose

The `grm.hap` program calculates a Genomic Relationship Matrix (GRM) from haplotype data. Specifically, it computes an Additive Haplotype GRM, which is stored with the extension `.g.AH`. This type of GRM can be useful for analyses considering haplotype effects rather than individual SNP effects. The program is parallelized using MPI and ScaLAPACK.

### Options

The command-line options for `grm.hap` are very similar to those for `grm.snp`.

*   **Positional Arguments:** `<chr_file1> [<chr_file2> ...]`
    *   One or more input files containing haplotype data. These files can be be per-chromosome or as one large file (often faster). The input format usually consists of phased haplotype pairs per individual. The first column is individual ID, followed by pairs of haplotype identifiers or sequences.

*   `-n <block_size>`:
    *   Specifies the block size for ScaLAPACK operations. This can impact performance and memory distribution. Default: `128`.

*   `-r <num_proc_rows>`:
    *   Overrides the automatically determined number of processor rows in the BLACS (Basic Linear Algebra Communication Subprograms) grid.

*   `-c <num_proc_cols>`:
    *   Overrides the automatically determined number of processor columns in the BLACS grid.

*   `-o <output_name_prefix>`:
    *   Prefix for the output GRM file. The program will append the extension `.g.AH` to this prefix. Default: `grm`.
    *   For example, if `-o myhapgrm` is used, the output file will be `myhapgrm.g.AH`.

### Example Usage

To calculate an additive haplotype GRM from data in two files (`chr1.haps`, `chr2.haps`), using 4 MPI processes, and saving the output file with the prefix `wheat_haplotypes`:

```bash
mpirun -np 4 ./bin/grm.hap -o wheat_haplotypes chr1.haps chr2.haps
```

This command will produce the binary matrix file:
*   `wheat_haplotypes.g.AH`
