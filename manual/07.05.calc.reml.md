## REML

Iterative calculations using REML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) CE (Conditional Expectation) method to estimate variance components and calculate heritabilities.

### Initialization

Before the iterative process begins, several matrices and variables are initialized:

1.  **Variance Components ($\sigma^2$)**: Initial estimates for variance components are provided or set to default values. These include genetic variances (e.g., $\sigma^2_{a,d,aa,ah,...}$) and the residual variance ($\sigma^2_e$).

2.  **Genomic Relationship Matrix (G)**: This matrix quantifies the genetic relatedness between individuals. It's computed from marker and haplotype data (GRMs).

3.  **Phenotype Vector (y)**: A vector containing the phenotypic observations for the trait of interest.

4.  **Design Matrix for Fixed Effects (X)**: This matrix relates phenotypic observations to fixed effects (e.g., herd, year, sex, season, etc). It includes a column of ones for the overall mean.

5.  **Incidence Matrix for Random Effects (Z)**: This matrix relates phenotypic observations to the random genetic effects of individuals. If phenotypes are directly on individuals in the G matrix (no missing data), Z can be an identity matrix or a submatrix of an identity matrix if not all individuals in G have phenotypes. If there are multiple random effects, there will be a corresponding Z_i for each G_i.

6.  **Phenotypic Variance-Covariance Matrix (V)**: This is constructed based on the initial variance components:
    $$\mathbf{V} = (\sum_i \sigma^2_i * \mathbf{Z}_i * \mathbf{G}_i * \mathbf{Z}_i^T ) + \sigma^2_e * \mathbf{I}$$
    where:
    *   $\sigma^2_i$ is the variance for the i-th random effect.
    *   $\sigma^2_e$ is the residual variance.
    *   $\mathbf{Z}_i$ is the incidence matrix for the i-th random effect.
    *   $\mathbf{G}_i$ is the Genomic Relationship Matrix for the i-th random effect.
    *   $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.

7.  **P Matrix**: This matrix is central to REML equations and is derived from V and X:
    $$\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{V}^{-1} - \mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{X})^{-}\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{V}^{-1}$$
    This matrix projects the data onto the space orthogonal to the fixed effects.

### Expectation-Maximization EM-REML Iteration

The EM-REML algorithm is an iterative approach to estimate variance components. Each iteration consists of an Expectation (E) step and a Maximization (M) step. 

The P matrix is recalculated in each iteration using the updated variance components from the previous iteration: 
$$\mathbf{V}_{(t)} = \sum_i (\sigma^2_{i,(t)} * \mathbf{Z}_i \mathbf{G}_i \mathbf{Z}_i^T) + \sigma^2_{e,(t)} * \mathbf{I}$$
$$\mathbf{P}_{(t)} = \mathbf{V}_{(t)}^{-1} - \mathbf{V}_{(t)}^{-1}\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{V}_{(t)}^{-1}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{V}_{(t)}^{-1}$$

The update equations for the variance components ($\sigma^2$) are as follows:

For a genetic variance component $\sigma^2_j$ (associated with $\mathbf{S}_j = \mathbf{Z}_j \mathbf{G}_j \mathbf{Z}_j^T$):

$$\sigma^2_{j,(t+1)} = (\sigma^2_{j,(t)} * y^T \mathbf{P}_{(t)} \mathbf{S}_j \mathbf{P}_{(t)} y) / tr(\mathbf{P}_{(t)} \mathbf{S}_j)$$

For the residual variance component $\sigma^2_e$ (associated $\mathbf{S}_e = \mathbf{I}$):

$$\sigma^2_{e,(t+1)} = (\sigma^2_{e,(t)} * y^T \mathbf{P}_{(t)} \mathbf{P}_{(t)} y) / tr(\mathbf{P}_{(t)})$$

Where:
*   $`\sigma^2_{k,(t+1)}`$ is the new estimate for the variance component `k` at iteration `t+1`.
*   $`\sigma^2_{k,(t)}`$ is the estimate from the previous iteration `t`.
*   $`y`$ is the vector of phenotypes.
*   $`\mathbf{P}_{t}`$ is the $\mathbf{P}$ matrix calculated using variance components from iteration `t`.
*   $`\mathbf{S}_j = \mathbf{Z}_j \mathbf{G}_j \mathbf{Z}_j^T`$ is the matrix for the j-th genetic component.
*   $`\mathbf{I}`$ is the Identity matrix.

The process repeats until convergence criteria are met: heritability or variance threshold.

### Average Information AI-REML Iteration

The AI-REML algorithm often converges faster than EM-REML. It uses an approximation of the Hessian of the REML log-likelihood, known as the Average Information (AI) matrix.

The update rule for the vector of variance components $\theta = [\sigma^2_1, \sigma^2_2, ..., \sigma^2_k]^T$ at iteration $`t`$ is:

$$\theta_{(t+1)} = \theta_{(t)} + \Delta\theta_{(t)}$$

Where $\Delta\theta_{(t)}$ is the solution to the system:

$$AI_{(t)} * \Delta\theta_{(t)} = s_{(t)}$$

Where:

*   $`\theta_{(t)}`$ is the vector of current variance component estimates.
*   $`AI_{(t)}`$ is the Average Information matrix evaluated at $\theta_{(t)}$.
*   $`s_{(t)}`$ is the vector of first derivatives of the REML log-likelihood (score vector) with respect to each variance component, evaluated at $\theta_{(t)}$.

**1. Score Vector (s)**:
The $k^{th}$ element of the score vector, $s_k$, corresponding to variance component $\sigma^2_k$ (associated with $\mathbf{S}_k$, where $\mathbf{S}_k = \mathbf{Z}_k \mathbf{G}_k \mathbf{Z}_k^T$ for a genetic component or $\mathbf{S}_e = \mathbf{I}$ for residual), is calculated as:

$$s_k = \frac{1}{2} * ( y^T \mathbf{P}_{(t)} \mathbf{S}_k \mathbf{P}_{(t)} y - tr(\mathbf{P}_{(t)} \mathbf{S}_k) )$$

In `reml.cpp`, this corresponds to `delta_ai[current_name] = (dtmp - trace)/2.0;` where `dtmp` is the quadratic form $`y^T \mathbf{P} \mathbf{S} \mathbf{P} y`$ and `trace` is $`tr(\mathbf{P} \mathbf{S})`$ for the specific component.

**2. Average Information (AI) Matrix**: 
The element $AI_{(i,j)}$ corresponding to variance components $\sigma^2_i$ and $\sigma^2_j$ (with $\mathbf{S}_i$ and $\mathbf{S}_j$ respectively), is given by:

$$AI_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} * tr(\mathbf{P}_{(t)} \mathbf{S}_i \mathbf{P}_{(t)} \mathbf{S}_j)$$

(Note: We calculate AI elements as $`\frac{1}{2} * y^T \mathbf{P} \mathbf{S}_i \mathbf{P} \mathbf{S}_j \mathbf{P} y`$. This is known as the *Observed Information* matrix. For simplicity in this manual, we refer to it as AI,.)

**3. Update Step**:
First, the P matrix is formed using current variance estimates:
$$\mathbf{V}_{(t)} = \sum (\sigma^2_{i,(t)} * \mathbf{Z}_i \mathbf{G}_i \mathbf{Z}_i^T) + \sigma^2_{e,(t)} * \mathbf{I}$$
$$\mathbf{P}_{(t)} = \mathbf{V}_{(t)}^{-1} - \mathbf{V}_{(t)}^{-1}\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{V}_{(t)}^{-1}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{V}_{(t)}^{-1}$$

Then, the system $AI_{(t)} * \Delta\theta_{(t)} = s_{(t)}$ is solved for $\Delta\theta_{(t)}$. In the code, `dppsv` is used to solve this, storing the result $\Delta\theta_{(t)}$ in `dltmp`.

The new variance components are then proposed as:
$$\theta_{(t+1),proposed} = \theta_{(t)} + \Delta\theta_{(t)}$$

The code includes safeguards to the minimum eigenvalue of the AI matrix for positive definiteness and step quality) to ensure that the proposed update is sensible (e.g., variance estimates remain non-negative). If the AI step is not deemed appropriate (e.g., if the AI matrix is not positive definite or the update leads to out-of-bounds estimates), the algorithm might revert to an EM-REML step for that iteration.

If the AI step is accepted, $\theta_{(t+1)} = \theta_{(t+1),proposed}$. These new estimates then become the current estimates for the next iteration.

### Convergence Criteria

The iterative process (either EM-REML or AI-REML) continues until one or more convergence criteria are met, or the maximum number of iterations is reached. The common criteria used are:

1.  **Change in Variance Estimates**:
    The algorithm monitors the absolute difference in variance estimates between successive iterations.
    Let $\sigma^2_{k,(t)}$ be the estimate of the $k^{th}$ variance component at iteration $`t`$.
    The change is $$\Delta\sigma^2_k = |\sigma^2_{k,(t+1)} - \sigma^2_{k,(t)}|$$
    If the maximum of these changes $(max(\Delta\sigma^2_k)$ for all $k$) falls below a predefined tolerance, the algorithm will stop.

2.  **Change in Heritabilities**:
    Similarly, the change in heritability estimates can be used as a convergence criterion.
    Heritability ($h^2$) for a component $`j`$ is typically calculated as $h^2_j = \sigma^2_j / \sigma^2_{Total}$, where $\sigma^2_{Total}$ is the sum of all variance components (excluding residual variance for some definitions, or including it for others.
    The change is $\Delta h^2_k = |h^2_{k,(t+1)} - h^2_{k,(t)}|$.
    If the maximum of these changes $(max(\Delta h^2_k))$ falls below a user defined heritability tolerance, the algorithm will stop.

3.  **Maximum Number of Iterations**:
    A hard limit on the number of iterations is set by the user. If convergence is not achieved within this limit, the algorithm stops, and the current estimates are reported.

The **REML** iterations will terminate if:
*   The maximum absolute difference between variance estimates from the current and previous iteration is less than or equal to the user-defined variance tolerance.
*   OR, the maximum absolute difference between heritability estimates from the current and previous iteration is less than or equal to the user-defined heritability tolerance.
*   OR, the number of iterations reaches user defined max iterations.
