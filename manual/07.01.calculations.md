# Calculations

This section details the mathematical calculations and algorithms used to create the Genomic Relationship Matrices (GRMs) from SNP and haplotype data. These GRMs quantify the genetic similarity between individuals.
Then the iterative calculations performed in the REML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) analysis are described.

## Matrix Dimensions

* $Nm =$ number of non-missing phenotypic records (these are used as the training population)
* $n =$ number of genotyped individuals in the population
* $mq =$ number of SNPs
* $y = N \times c$ (non-missing phenotypic records, $c=1$ if no fixed effects or covariables),
        assumed to follow normal distribution
* $\mathbf{Z} =  N \times n$ (incidence matrix)
* $\mathbf{X} = n \times c$  (model matrix)
* $\mathbf{G}_{i} = n \times n$ (genomic‚Äêrelationship matrix for this variance)
