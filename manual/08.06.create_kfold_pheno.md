## create.kfold.pheno.py

### Purpose

create k files with N/k random rows set to missing value

### Options

To view the specific command-line options and their descriptions for `create.kfold.pheno.py`, please execute the script with the `--help` argument:

```bash
python scripts/create-kfold-pheno.py --help
```

The script accepts the following command-line options:

*   `pheno`: Path to the input phenotype/data file.
*   `-n/--column-name NAME`: Name of the column to process (used if file has a header).
*   `-c/--column N`: 0-based index of the column to process for creating validation sets. (Default: 2, i.e., the 3rd column).
*   `-k/--kfolds K`: Number of k-folds to generate. (Default: 10)
*   `-p/--percent P`: Percent of the population to set as missing for validation in each fold. (Default: 10)
*   `-m/--missing-value VAL`: Symbol to use for missing values. (Default: -9999111)
*   `--noheader`: Set if the input file has no header row. (Default: False, assumes header is present)
*   `-V/--verbose`: Verbose output. (Default: False)

### Example Usage

Below is an example command showing how `create.kfold.pheno.py` could be used:

```bash
python scripts/create-kfold-pheno.py \
    my_phenotypes.txt \
    --column-name age \
    -k 5 \
    -p 20 \
    -m NA \
    --verbose
```

This command instructs the script to:

- Process the input file `my_phenotypes.txt`.
- Target the column named `age` for creating validation sets (assumes a header is present).
- Generate 5 k-fold files.
- In each file, set 20% of the individuals in the target column to the missing value `NA`.

The output files will be named by inserting the fold number before the last extension, e.g., `my_phenotypes.1.txt`, `my_phenotypes.2.txt`, ..., `my_phenotypes.5.txt`.
