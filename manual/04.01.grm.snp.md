## grm.snp

### Purpose

The `grm.snp` program calculates Genomic Relationship Matrices (GRMs) from SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data. It can compute various types of GRMs, including:

*   Additive GRM (`.g.A`)
*   Dominance GRM (`.g.D`)
*   Second-order epistatic GRMs:
    *   Additive x Additive (`.g.AA`)
    *   Additive x Dominance (`.g.AD`)
    *   Dominance x Dominance (`.g.DD`)

These matrices are typically used in genetic analyses, such as variance component estimation with REML. The program is parallelized using MPI and ScaLAPACK.

### Options

*   **Positional Arguments:** `<chr_file1> [<chr_file2> ...]`
    *   One or more input files containing SNP data. These files are expected to be per-chromosome. The format is typically a text file where the first line is a header (e.g., marker IDs) and subsequent lines are individuals, with genotypes coded numerically (e.g., 0, 1, 2). The first column of each data line is usually an individual ID.

*   `-n <block_size>`:
    *   Specifies the block size for ScaLAPACK operations. This can affect performance and memory distribution. Default: `2`.

*   `-r <num_proc_rows>`:
    *   Overrides the automatically determined number of processor rows in the BLACS (Basic Linear Algebra Communication Subprograms) grid.

*   `-c <num_proc_cols>`:
    *   Overrides the automatically determined number of processor columns in the BLACS grid.

*   `-o <output_name_prefix>`:
    *   Prefix for the output GRM files. The program will append extensions like `.g.A`, `.g.D`, `.g.AA`, etc., to this prefix. Default: `grm`.
    *   For example, if `-o mygrm` is used, output files will be `mygrm.g.A`, `mygrm.g.D`, and so on.

### Example Usage

To calculate GRMs from SNP data spread across three chromosome files (`chr1.snps`, `chr2.snps`, `chr3.snps`), using 8 MPI processes, and saving the output files with the prefix `dairy_cattle`:

```bash
# run with 8 mpi tasks (ranks) and 2 threads per task/rank
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=2
mpirun -np 8 ./bin/grm.snp -o dairy_cattle chr1.snps chr2.snps chr3.snps
```

This command will produce files such as:
*   `dairy_cattle.g.A`
*   `dairy_cattle.g.D`
*   `dairy_cattle.g.AA`
*   `dairy_cattle.g.AD`
*   `dairy_cattle.g.DD`

Each file is a binary matrix storing the respective genomic relationships.
