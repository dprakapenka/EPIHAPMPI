## count-snps.py

### Purpose

counts the number of SNPs in each chromosome file

### Options

To view the specific command-line options and their descriptions for `count-snps.py`, please execute the script with the `--help` argument:

```bash
python scripts/count-snps.py --help
```

The script accepts the following command-line options:

*   `-i/--input INPUT [INPUT ...]`: path to input files [required]
*   `-o/--output OUTPUT`: output file name (Default: count-snps.log)
*   `--prefix PREFIX`: prefix in front of output lines (default: geno_snp)
*   `--nosort`: Disable sorting of input files by number in filename. (Sorting is enabled by default)

### Example Usage

Below is an example command showing how `count-snps.py` could be used:

```bash
python scripts/count-snps.py \
    --input chr1.dat chr2.dat chr10.dat \
    --prefix snp_geno \
    --output snp_counts.log
```

This command instructs the script to:

- Process the input files `chr1.dat`, `chr2.dat`, and `chr10.dat`.
- Count the number of snps in each file. The script determines this by reading the first line, splitting it by whitespace, and calculating `(number of columns - 1) / 2`.
- Print the counts to standard output in the format `geno_snp <count> <filename>`.
- Input files will be sorted by default based on numbers in their filenames before processing (e.g., `chr1.dat`, `chr2.dat`, `chr10.dat`). Use `--nosort` to process in the order they are provided on the command line.

**Note:** The actual option names and usage may differ. Please consult the script's `--help` output for precise information.
