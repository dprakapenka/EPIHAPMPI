## rank

### Purpose

The `rank` program is used to calculate the numerical rank of one or more distributed symmetric matrices, typically Genomic Relationship Matrices (GRMs), stored in binary format. It reads GRM files (e.g., `.g.A`, `.g.D`, `.g.AA`) associated with a given base name, computes their eigenvalues using ScaLAPACK, and then counts how many eigenvalues are significantly greater than zero to determine the rank.

This is useful for diagnosing multicollinearity issues or understanding the effective dimensionality of the genomic information captured in a GRM.

### Options

The `rank` program uses the same common option parser as `reml`. However, many of the options applicable to `reml` (like those for phenotype or variance component values) are not directly used by `rank` for its core computation, though they will be parsed if provided.

**Primary Options:**

*   `--input <load_name>` / `-i <load_name>` or **Positional Argument** `<load_name>`:
    *   Specifies the base name for the GRM files. The program will iterate through a predefined list of known GRM extensions (e.g., `.g.A`, `.g.D`, `.g.AH`, `.g.AA`, `.g.AD`, `.g.DD`, `.g.AAA`, etc.) and attempt to load and calculate the rank for each file found under `<load_name><extension>`.
    *   If `--input` is not used, the first positional argument is taken as `<load_name>`.
    *   Default for `<load_name>` if not specified: `grm`.

**ScaLAPACK/BLACS Options:**

*   `--blocks <size>` / `-n <size>`:
    *   Sets the ScaLAPACK block size for matrix operations, which can affect performance and memory distribution during eigenvalue computation. Default: `128` (but the program might adjust this if the matrix dimension is smaller).
*   `-r <num_proc_rows>`:
    *   Overrides the automatically calculated number of processor rows in the BLACS grid.
*   `-c <num_proc_cols>`:
    *   Overrides the automatically calculated number of processor columns in the BLACS grid.

### Example Usage

To calculate the rank of all standard GRM files associated with the base name `dairy_study` using 4 MPI processes:

```bash
mpirun -np 4 ./bin/rank dairy_study
```

The program will output the base name, followed by a list of GRM types found (e.g., "a", "d", "aa") along with their calculated rank and the dimension of the matrix.

Example Output Snippet:
```
dairy_study
GRM, RANK, IND
a, 1000, 1000
d, 998, 1000
aa, 950, 1000
...
```
This indicates that for `dairy_study.g.A` (dimension 1000x1000), the rank is 1000, etc.
