## read.bin

### Purpose

The `read.bin` program is a utility tool designed to inspect binary matrix files that are generated by other programs in this suite (e.g., `grm.snp`, `grm.hap`). These binary files typically store a header with matrix dimensions (rows and columns) followed by the matrix elements as `double` precision floating-point numbers in row-major order.

This tool allows you to print the top-left N x N corner of such a matrix to the standard output for quick verification or inspection.

### Options

*   **Positional Argument:** `<matrix_file>`
    *   The path to the binary matrix file you want to inspect (e.g., `mygrm.g.A`, `output.bin`). This is a required argument.

*   `-n N` (where `N` is an integer):
    *   Specifies the number of rows and columns to display from the top-left corner of the matrix.
    *   Default: If not specified, `N` defaults to `10`. So, it will print a 10x10 submatrix. If the matrix dimensions are smaller than N, it will print the entire matrix or the largest possible square submatrix.

*   `-h, --help`:
    *   Displays a help message summarizing usage and options, then exits.

### Example Usage

To print the top-left 5x5 corner of a binary matrix file named `project_alpha.g.AD`:
```bash
./bin/read.bin -n 5 project_alpha.g.AD
```

To print the default 10x10 corner of a matrix file `final_grm.bin`:
```bash
./bin/read.bin final_grm.bin
```

The output will be formatted numbers representing the matrix elements, printed to the console.
