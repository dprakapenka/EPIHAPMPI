### Haplotype-based Additive Genomic Relationship Matrix

This GRM utilizes phased haplotype information, where unique haplotype sequences within defined genomic blocks are treated as distinct alleles. For more information refer to the [@Da2022].

#### Input Data

The primary input for this calculation is a "hap_geno" file which can be generated as described in [Haplotype Files](#haplotype-files) section using "scripts/get.hap.geno.parallel.py"[TODO:LINK]. For each individual in the population, and for each defined haplotype block in the genome, the file specifies a pair of unique integer identifiers for the haplotype sequences within the block. These integers are unique labels assigned to distinct haplotype sequences that occur within that specific block across the population. 

#### Methodology

The $\mathbf{G}_{AH}$ matrix is constructed by processing the genome block by block. Let $n$ be the number of individuals.

Then for each haplotype block $b$ in the genome:

##### Calculate block frequencies
All unique haplotype identifiers within block $b$ across all $n$ individuals are identified. For each unique haplotype identifier $h$ in block $b$, let $count_{bh}$ be its total count considering both haplotype copies from each of the $n$ individuals. The frequency of haplotype $h$ in block $b$, denoted $p_{bh}$, is then calculated as:
$$p_{bh} = \frac{count_{bh}}{2n}$$

##### Reference‚ÄêMinor Coding for Each Block
The most frequent haplotype identifier in block $b$ is designated as the reference (or major) haplotype for that block. This reference haplotype is denoted as $M_b$ and corresponds to `hap_max_key` in the code.

For every unique haplotype identifier $k'$ that is present in block $b$ but is *not* the reference haplotype $M_b$ (i.e., $k' \neq M_b$):

- Let $p_{bk'}$ be the frequency of this non-reference haplotype $k'$ in block $b$
- For each individual $i$, determine $X_{ibk'}$, which is the count of haplotype $k'$ that individual $i$ possesses in block $b$. This count can be 0, 1, or 2.
- $w_{ibk'}$, is then created for individual $i$ corresponding to this specific non-reference haplotype $k'$ in block $b$. The formula for this variable is:
  $$w_{ibk'} = -(X_{ibk'} - 2p_{bk'})$$
  This formula expands to the following values based on the count $X_{ibk'}$:
    - If $X_{ibk'} = 0$: $w_{ibk'} = 2p_{bk'}$
    - If $X_{ibk'} = 1$: $w_{ibk'} = 2p_{bk'} - 1$
    - If $X_{ibk'} = 2$: $w_{ibk'} = 2p_{bk'} - 2$
- If an individual's block allele information for block $b$ is 0 it is treated as missing, the corresponding $w_{ibk'}$ stay 0, meaning they do not contribute to relationship calculations for that specific block allele.
    - If individual $i$ has zero copies of $k'$ in block $b$ ($X_{ibk'} = 0$): $w_{ibk'} = 2p_{bk'}$
    - If individual $i$ has one copy of $k'$ in block $b$ ($X_{ibk'} = 1$): $w_{ibk'} = 2p_{bk'} - 1$
    - If individual $i$ has two copies of $k'$ in block $b$ ($X_{ibk'} = 2$): $w_{ibk'} = 2p_{bk'} - 2$

##### Assembly of the Global ($\mathbf{W}_{AH}$)
The coded variables $w_{ibk'}$ are assembled into a global predictor matrix $\mathbf{W}_{AH}$. This matrix has $n$ rows (one for each individual). The columns of $\mathbf{W}_{AH}$ are formed by concatenating the $w_{ibk'}$ vectors for all non-reference haplotypes $k'$ from all haplotype blocks $b$. If there are $B$ blocks in total, and block $b$ contains $u_b$ unique haplotype identifiers (thus $u_b-1$ non-reference haplotypes), the total number of columns in $\mathbf{W}_{AH}$ will be $\sum_{b=1}^{B} (u_b-1)$.

##### Calculation of the Haplotype GRM ($\mathbf{G}_{AH}$)

The $n \times n$ matrix $\mathbf{G}_{AH}$ is calculated as the product of $\mathbf{W}_{AH}$ and its transpose:
$$\mathbf{G}_{AH} = \mathbf{W}_{AH} \mathbf{W}_{AH}^T$$
Each element $(\mathbf{G}_{AH})_{il}$ in this matrix, representing the relationship between individual $i$ and individual $l$, is computed as:
$$(\mathbf{G}_{AH})_{il} = \sum_{b=1}^{B} \sum_{k' \neq M_b} w_{ibk'} w_{lbk'}$$
Substituting the expression for $w_{ibk'}$:
$$(\mathbf{G}_{AH})_{il} = \sum_{b=1}^{B} \sum_{k' \neq M_b} (-(X_{ibk'} - 2p_{bk'})) (-(X_{lbk'} - 2p_{bk'}))$$
$$(\mathbf{G}_{AH})_{il} = \sum_{b=1}^{B} \sum_{k' \neq M_b} (X_{ibk'} - 2p_{bk'}) (X_{lbk'} - 2p_{bk'})$$
